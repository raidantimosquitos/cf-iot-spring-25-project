## Key features

### IMU (Inertia Measuring Unit)

Track body movement, posture, and fall events with a high-precision IMU. From subtle shifts to sudden impacts, **SH+™ wearable band** captures motion data in real time—useful for physical therapy monitoring, elderly care, and fall detection.

### Pulse Sensor

Continuously monitor heart rate with a built-in optical pulse sensor. Whether it's resting, active, or irregular rhythms, our system detects it and flags anomalies for review by health professionals or caregivers.

### Buzzer-alert system

Local alerts ensure you (or the wearer) never miss a critical event. When thresholds are crossed—like abnormal heart rate or lack of movement—a discreet buzzer provides instant feedback, even before the cloud gets the message.

### Wi-Fi Enabled: Gateway-to-Cloud Connectivity

**SH+™ wearable band** doesn't just collect data—it sends it where it matters. Through Wi-Fi connectivity to a local gateway, vital signs and motion data are securely transmitted to the cloud, enabling real-time dashboards, alerts, and remote monitoring by healthcare providers or family.

## Secure and Scalable

- **End-to-end encryption** from device to cloud.
- **Modular APIs** for integration into existing health platforms.
- **Cloud dashboards** with customizable alert thresholds.
- **OTA firmware updates** to future-proof your device.

## Who is it for?

- **Elderly and at-risk individuals** needing passive, continuous monitoring
- **Clinics, retirement homes and hospitals** deploying wearable tech for outpatient care
- **Researchers** gathering granular motion and vitals data
- **Caregivers** who need real-time insight into their loved one’s health
