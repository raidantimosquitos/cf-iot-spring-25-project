### From raw sensor data to actionable insights. One platform. Infinite potential.

Designed to complement our [SH+™ wearable bands]({{< ref "/products/prod01" >}}), **SH+™ Cloud** transforms streams of physiological and motion data into clear, timely, and intelligent health insights. It's not just a dashboard—it's your command center for connected care.

## 🌐 Centralized, scalable and seriously smart

Whether you’re managing **10 devices or 10,000**, **SH+™ Cloud** gives you a single pane of glass to monitor, analyze, and act. Real-time data sync from all devices ensures zero lag between what's happening and what you see.

## 🔑 Core features

### 🧠 AI-Powered Health Analytics

Our machine learning models continuously analyze incoming data to detect abnormal patterns—before they become emergencies. From arrhythmias to fall risk, **SH+™ Cloud** flags anomalies and prioritizes alerts using adaptive thresholds based on individual baselines.

### 📊 Live Dashboards & Trend Visualizations

No more drowning in data. Get clean, customizable dashboards that highlight key vitals, movement trends, compliance stats, and more. Drill down by individual, group, or timeframe.

### 🚨 Intelligent Alerting System

Set rules once, and let the system do the heavy lifting. Alerts can be triggered based on combinations of events—like elevated heart rate plus lack of motion—reducing false positives and alert fatigue.

### 📁 Secure Data Storage & API Access

- Fully encrypted cloud storage (HIPAA/GDPR ready).
- Raw and processed data available via REST API.
  -Seamless integration with EHR, clinical tools, or your custom platform.

### 🔄 Bi-Directional Sync & Remote Configuration

Configure devices remotely, push OTA firmware updates, or adjust thresholds on-the-fly—all from the dashboard. Managing wearables at scale has never been easier.

## 🤖 What Can the AI Detect?

- **Fall prediction models** trained on IMU data patterns.
- **Heart rate anomalies** based on dynamic baselines.
- **Behavioral drift** over time (e.g., reduced mobility, irregular routines).
- **Early warnings** for potential health deterioration.

And with every new data point, the system gets smarter.
